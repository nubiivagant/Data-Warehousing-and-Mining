# Data Warehousing and Mining ðŸ“Š

Comprehensive implementation of Data Preprocessing, EDA, Machine Learning Models, and Data Mining Techniques using Python.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of key concepts from **Data Warehousing and Data Mining**. It is designed to help understand and apply data handling techniques, predictive modeling, clustering, classification, and association rule mining.

Each module demonstrates real-world applications using Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
